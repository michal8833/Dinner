# Dinner

Solution for the following problem:<br/>
A meeting is taking place. There is a given number of people, tables and seats at each table (the same for each).<br/>
There are 3 courses. During each of them, each person changes their seat. They must do this in such a way that each person, during the meeting, sits at the same table with as many people as possible.<br/>
The program prints out the seat codes and IDs of the people sitting at those seats after the third course.
